# Getting Started with Laurel Achievement System

The v1 currently contains the basic funcitonality directly replicated from our appscript Project

## TODO:

I've figured the way to implemet the link system for each user
it uses the ### `react-router-dom` library provided by React.

I've implemented the library on a demo project you just have to implement it here without breaking the whole app
